This is a simple **Task Management Microservice** built in **Go**.  
It demonstrates:

✅ Microservices architecture principles  
✅ Clean separation of concerns (Handler → Service → Repository → DB)  
✅ Pagination & Filtering  
✅ RESTful API Design  
✅ Scalability considerations  
✅ Ready for future inter-service communication (User Service can be added)
